## Software Supply Chain Security – Assignment 1

## Project Description
This repository contains the assignment for *Software Supply Chain Security – Assignment 1*.
The goal of this project is to explore and demonstrate key concepts of securing the software supply chain — including managing dependencies, verifying artifact provenance, protecting the build and deployment pipeline, and reducing risk >
The code and configurations here serve as a practical implementation and learning exercise for these supply-chain security topics.
